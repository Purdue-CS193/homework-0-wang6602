# Alan Wang's First CS193 Homework

Some of my favorite things in CS193

- The tools we learn, such as Git, Github, terminal, etc. are valuable skills that I've heard are often overlooked in other CS courses
- The TAs explain concepts throughly
- I get to meet new people frequently
- The work is very resonable, helpful, and straightforward
